Change: Update dependencies and require Go 1.22 or newer

We have updated all dependencies. Since some libraries require newer Go standard
library features, support for Go 1.18 to 1.21 has been dropped, which means
that rest-server now requires at least Go 1.22 to build.

This also disables support for TLS versions older than TLS 1.2.
